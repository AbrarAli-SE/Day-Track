# Day Track – Finance Core

Welcome to the foundational repo for **Day Track**, a personal life management app starting with finance tracking and cloud-based data sync.

## 🌟 What This Project Aims to Do

This repository focuses on building the **core finance module** of Day Track, including:

- Expense logging and categorization
- Receivables and payables tracking
- Smart reminders for upcoming payments
- Cloud-based data storage with auto-sync
- Multi-device access for seamless user experience

The goal is to create a scalable, modular base that can later expand into a full personal assistant app.
